  abstract = {This article demontrates that we can apply deep learning to text
understanding from character-level inputs all the way up to abstract text
concepts, using temporal convolutional networks (ConvNets). We apply ConvNets
to various large-scale datasets, including ontology classification, sentiment
analysis, and text categorization. We show that temporal ConvNets can achieve
astonishing performance without the knowledge of words, phrases, sentences and
any other syntactic or semantic structures with regards to a human language.
Evidence shows that our models can work for both English and Chinese.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},
